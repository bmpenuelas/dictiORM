Autogenerated docs
==================

DictiORM is a tiny MongoDB ORM that takes zero time to setup because docs become simple dicts. Read and write the documents in your database like if you were using normal dictionary variables in Python.

All the database accesses are abstracted for you. If you know how to use a Python dictionary, that's all you need to read and write a MongoDB database.
